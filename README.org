* Overview

  BBOPX JS the experimental wing of the [[http://github.com/kltm/bbop-js][BBOP JS]] library.

  As this is an experimental library, although the code may be used,
  it will forever be pre-1.0.

** Usage

   BBOPX has a slightly better thought out shim, meaning that using in
   a CommonJS environment is a little easier:

  #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
var bbopx = require('bbopx');
  #+END_SRC

   As opposed to BBOP's (currently odd) form:
   
  #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
var bbop = require('bbop').bbop;
  #+END_SRC


** API
   More or less current API documentation can be found [[https://kltm.github.io/bbopx-js/][here]].
